## Selected professional experience
### International Council on Clean Transportation (2015-2017, Washington, D.C.)
_**Researcher**_<br />
- Collect/refine raw data and perform emissions and cost modeling to evaluate the cost-benefit of HFC-134a phase-out pathways from the Chinese light-duty vehicle fleet
-	Perform data mining (with R and Python) using 15+ years of air quality monitoring data from across the Sao Paulo, Brazil metro area (10+ stations) and provide insights to the local regulators of vehicles emissions
-	Set up and optimize WRF/CMAQ (UNIX-based meteorological and air quality modeling systems)
-	Research algorithms and spatial surrogates and dis-aggregate country-level diesel vehicle emission data into grid cells for air quality and health modeling using ArcGIS (results published in Nature)

### Washington University in St. louis (2009-2015, St. Louis, MO)
_**Graduate researcher**_
- Ensure data quality and data integrity of the 15+ years of air quality data collected from multiple monitoring stations across the metropolitan St. Louis area
- Test and optimize the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to quantitatively identify the sources and their contributions to PM2.5 in the St. Louis area
-	Develop regression models to estimate uncertainties associated with air quality data reported by the U.S. national air monitoring networks
-	Apply advanced statistical methods and data mining techniques in R to characterize the measurement errors within air monitoring networks and explore the spatial variability of air pollutants in St. Louis
- Manage a 5-year air quality monitoring project in Roxana, IL and perform data collection and QA/QC. Regularly discuss the findings with stakeholders (local government, environmental groups and managers of local industries)

### Tsinghua University (2007-2009, Beijing, China)
_**Graduate research assistant**_
-	Conducted on-site stack air sampling and lab analysis for heavy metals to assist the development of source profiles at Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. Ltd (China)
-	Tested multiple cook stoves in the rural households of China to assess their impacts to indoor air quality
